MySQL Database Directives
=========================

MySQLInfo
---------

Syntax: MySQLInfo host user pass dbname
Default: none
Context: server config, virtual host

   Configures the MySQL database driver (the database may be remote).  A
connection isn't made until use of a SQL feature requires it, after
which it may be held open for the lifetime of the FTP session depending
on the directives in use.  Use `""' to specify a null password.
