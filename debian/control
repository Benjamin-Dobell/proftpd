Depends: proftpd-basic, proftpd-mod-mysql, proftpd-mod-pgsql, proftpd-mod-ldap
Description: versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon
 ProFTPd is a powerful replacement for wu-ftpd. This File Transfer Protocol
 daemon supports hidden directories, virtual hosts, and per-directory
 ".ftpaccess" files. It uses a single main configuration file, with a
 syntax similar to Apache.
 .
 Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories can have
 an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
 not needed). Advanced features such as multiple password files and
 upload/download ratios are also supported.
 .
 This is a convenience transitional package used to install all provided
 modules, so you can safely remove it after upgrading. You should
 alternatively install proftpd-basic and one or more of the other 
 proftpd-mod-* packages if you need advanced features.
