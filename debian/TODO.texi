Activates support for retrieving per-user ratios from the database.  To
use this feature, @samp{SQLUserTable} (mod_sql) and @samp{Ratios on}
(mod_ratios) directives are needed.

For this to work you need to compile with -DMOD_MYSQL_RATIOS, and use
mod_ratio version 2.0 or better.  The latest version is not included
with stock ProFTPD, but the Debian package has it compiled in.
