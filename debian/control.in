Description: Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - binaries
 ProFTPd is a powerful replacement for wu-ftpd. This File Transfer Protocol
 daemon supports hidden directories, virtual hosts, and per-directory
 ".ftpaccess" files. It uses a single main configuration file, with a
 syntax similar to Apache.
 .
 Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories can have
 an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
 not needed). Advanced features such as multiple password files and
 upload/download ratios are also supported.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and all main modules used for
 common configurations. If you need database-centric authentication 
 install the suitable proftpd-mod suggested package.
