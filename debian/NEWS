proftpd-dfsg (1.3.5b-3) unstable; urgency=medium

    Starting from this version, proftpd works by default in standalone mode at
    its first install. It is still possible to use inetd/xinetd mode, but the
    admin has to manage that manually by update-inetd or configuring xinetd.
    Some information about that are provided in the accompanying doc
    /usr/share/doc/proftpd-basic/README.Debian.

proftpd-dfsg (1.3.4~rc2-4) unstable; urgency=low

    The mod_ldap 2.9 version introduced in 1.3.4 series changed completely 
    configuration settings. See the Changes section in README.LDAP for 
    new configuration directives to be used and DO NOT assume you can simply 
    use your current configuration.

proftpd-dfsg (1.3.4~rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Starting from this version the core package does not provide the
    still experimental non-core mod_vroot package. You need to install the separate
    proftpd-mod-vroot package explicitly instead, or to comment the mod_vroot.c 
    loading in /etc/proftpd/modules.conf.

proftpd-dfsg (1.3.3d-4) unstable; urgency=low

    Starting from this version /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf also includes 
    all files present at /etc/proftpd/conf.d/ to allow a better customization
    without need of changing the main system files.

proftpd-dfsg (1.3.2e-3) unstable; urgency=low

    This version adds the useful contributed module mod_vroot, which is still not
    part of the standard modules. It can be used for providing shared
    directories under chrooted environments, among other useful features.
    A new template 'virtuals.conf' is provided also to keep things
    ordered about vhosts/vroots and show some examples.

proftpd-dfsg (1.3.2b-2) unstable; urgency=low

    This version stops client-initiated TLS renegotiations by default. This is
    a side effect of fixing CVE-2009-3555 in OpenSSL protocol. Unfortunately
    that could break some clients until a better approach is adopted to fix
    this protocol issue globally. In order to avoid connection losses in 
    those cases a new directive has been adopted:

    TLSOption AllowClientRenegotiations

    which can be added to tls.conf. It is currently commented out in Debian
    provided configuration as in default ProFTPD setting. 
    See also http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3324 for more information.
